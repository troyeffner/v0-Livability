# QB Autonomy Matrix

## Run Autonomously
- maintenance-only code/docs updates without product behavior change
- routine health, sync, and reporting commands
- approved bootstrap/scaffold tasks
- policy-approved security integrity refresh tasks

## Must Go To Work Queue First
- product behavior changes
- scope/roadmap changes
- data model/schema/contract changes
- infra/deploy/pipeline changes
- cross-repo extraction or ownership changes

## Must Escalate For Explicit Approval
- destructive/irreversible operations
- pricing/offering changes
- policy changes affecting multiple repos
