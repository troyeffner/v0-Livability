# QB (Quarterback) Operating Layer

Project: LIVABILITY

## Canon Operating Model
- Chief of Staff: `UXOS/00` (portfolio orchestration and governance).
- Product Manager: this repo's `00` thread (local planning and acceptance).
- QB: required interface between Chief and PM for status, dispatch, and reporting.

## Purpose
QB is the local execution layer for planning, dispatch, and reporting.
It keeps this repo aligned with UXOS ways of working.

## Commands
- `./QB/qb check` : governance and repo-health checks
- `./QB/qb plan` : generate next-action dispatch pack
- `./QB/qb report` : generate daily heartbeat summary
- `./QB/qb sync` : read recent git changes into a status-review note

## Required Governance Artifacts
- `QB/DECISION_LOG.md`
- `QB/RELEASE_GATE_CHECKLIST.md`
- `QB/RACI_LITE.md`

## Control Loop (Required)
1. Chief dispatches using canonical handoff format.
2. PM executes and updates `QB/status.json` and `QB/WORK_QUEUE.md`.
3. PM emits `QB/report_YYYYMMDD.md`.
4. Chief reviews outputs and reprioritizes.

## PM Update Model (Hybrid)
1. Event-based updates (required)
- Update `QB/status.json` on goal changes, blockers, major decisions, scope shifts, milestone changes.

2. Daily heartbeat (required)
- Generate one daily report from `QB/status.json`.

3. Prompt-driven deep updates (as needed)
- Use explicit planning prompts for pivots/replans.

## Autonomy and Queueing
- Use `QB/AUTONOMY_MATRIX.md` to decide if work can run autonomously.
- If not autonomous, add item to `QB/WORK_QUEUE.md` before execution.

## Source of Truth
- `QB/status.json` is canonical.
- `QB/DECISION_LOG.md` is canonical for decisions.
- Git changelog is advisory context only.

## Output Conventions
Every dispatch generated by QB must follow:
1. Project
2. Destination
3. Prompt
4. Acceptance
5. Return
